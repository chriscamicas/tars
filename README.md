# Tesla Autopilot Racing Simulator (TARS)
This is the code behind the slidedeck "How to learn neuroevolution by creating an autonomous car in your browser".

It's available in French on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/chriscamicas/decouvrir-la-neuroevolution-en-creant-une-voiture-autonome-dans-son-navigateur).

## Getting started
Just spin up a http server at the root of the repository and open the index file.

## What's inside
The folder structure follows the presentation. You will find animated examples inside each folder and you may explore the code behind.
* [What are Vectors ?](vector)
* [Vector addition](vector-add)
* [Draw a static car](car-static)
* [Let's make the car move](car-move)
* [Let's drive the car](car-manual)
* [Draw few walls](walls)
* [Let's fire few rays #HanShotFirst](ray)
* [How to find vectors intersection point ?](vector-intersect)
* [Ray casting in action](raycasting)
* [An autonomous but stupid car (but autonomous)](autonomous)
* [A whole population (of autonomous but stupid car but ...)](population)
* [Roulette selection algorithm](roulette)
* [Neuroevolution in action](neuroevolution)

Bonus
* [MarI/O code](mario)

## Greetings
Many thanks to
- The processing foundation, especially the [p5*js](https://p5js.org) community.
- [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com) for the inspiration and the wonderful work of [Daniel Shiffman](https://twitter.com/shiffman)
- [Laurent Alvaro (BeTomorrow)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IxXmuFrN2pLaK5S5DARkt0Uq0R7PDDqYJbAHf5aVxBY/edit?usp=sharing) for his introduction to neural networks (= the click in my understanding of neural networks)
